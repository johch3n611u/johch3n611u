Hi @Wing Kwok ,

Same issue with E2A-13802: [WTCHK][S3S1] Cart is refilled ( fill 裝滿 ) with unknown products just after an order is placed MORE INFO REQUIRED ( 必須的 ), due to product missing MOP price row cannot add to cart

Found another issue that Frontend passe wrong currency curr=HKD when set to Macau CCE, should pass curr=MOP

It will cause calulate cart using wrong currency

Please consult frontend team. Thanks.

FYI 是for your information
