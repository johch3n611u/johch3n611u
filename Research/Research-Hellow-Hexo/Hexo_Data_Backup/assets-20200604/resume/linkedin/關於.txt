I am graduated from Department of Landscape   architecture in Fu Yan University .In addition to the general design of relevant knowledge and some of the construction skills ,I also took the license of garden construction class B during the University . Because of the departmental vacancies and some personal considerations, I did not continue to go to the landscape design profession. Instead, I went to the nation workforce development agency to study the programming in January this year (the details can be seen in the attachment history), although the program development ability has yet to be refined. However, I hope that through the analysis and planning ability of the design department, I can not only be a programmer, but also be able to transposition thinking between user and programmer and also contribute to the programming position. 

I accessed to the great awards no matter national or regional in the design competition , bring learning into full play, and make use of learning skills in graduation design , such as hand-painted, related graphics software, 3D model simulation and video editing, etc. From the investigation,  nalysis, planning, design to results how to show communication and coordination with the partners .

In the third year of the university , I was going to the china area internship for a period of three months . At the beginning , base survey /  analysis , and lived locally to understanding of the local customs . Then, I designed the preliminary projects, also debated the possibility of construction with manufacturers. Discussed regulatory issues of the town government that  construction supervision and record at the beginning of construction . Allows me to know  how to adapt to the local situation in the shortest time when workin in  various regions , understood the case ,was familiar with the problem ,  and solved the complex problems in a timely manner . 

Thank you for read my autobiography .
